# Block Visibility Date and Time Add-On

WordPress has had the ability to schedule each post or page (or even stylistic changes in the customizer) for ages. Block Visibility Date and Time brings that ability to each and every block on your WordPress site.

An add-on for the [Block Visibility WordPress plugin](https://github.com/richardtape/block-visibility) that allows you to control when (both date and time) to start and/or stop showing a block on each of your posts or pages.

## Examples

Start showing a block at 12am on January 1st 2021 and stop showing it at 4:30pm on March 14th 2021. (i.e. only shown between 2 specific dates and times)

or

Stop showing a block at 11:15pm on November 14th 2022. (i.e. it is public until that date)

or

Start showing a block at 6am on May 23rd 2021 with no end date. (i.e. it is hidden until that date and time and public afterwards)

## Block Visibility

Works alongside the core [Block Visibility plugin](https://github.com/richardtape/block-visibility) and [User Role add-on](https://github.com/richardtape/block-visibility-user-role) meaning you can schedule blocks for dates and times and only shown them to those users signed in with a specific role.
